# Bill Reminder App

A common issue with most calendar apps is the inability to set recurring reminders on specific dates for common tasks; more often than not, these types of reminders will need to be manually set up which tends to be time-consuming and tedious which, this app solves just that!

The app will use Twilio as a way to send messages to your phone and will be able to set specific dates for reminders.
